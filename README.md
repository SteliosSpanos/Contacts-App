# Contacts Application
I made a small contacts app that uses maps as the primary data structure and gives the user a variety of choices to make.

## What I Learned
- I'm still practicing my skills on data structures and especially maps, so that was a great way to make them more understandable.
- The importance of choosing the correct data structure when building an application(even a small one) in order for it to function faster and with less effort from the developer.
